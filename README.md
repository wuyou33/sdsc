# sdsc
This repository constains a set of functions that implement the Sequential Design of Structured Controllers, described in our paper:
* Y. Zheng, R. P. Manson, and A. Papachristodoulou, ``Scalable Design of Structured Controllers using Chordal Decomposition'', IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2017, accepted, to appear

In particular, sdsc exploits the clique tree structure based on chordal decomposition (see the detailed descriptions in our paper).
